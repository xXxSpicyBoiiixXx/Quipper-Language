-- | This tool trims excess controls from gates. Specifically, it
-- decomposes a circuit so that:
--
-- * not-gates, Pauli /X/-, /Y/-, and /Z/-gates, and /iX/-gates have
-- at most two controls;
--
-- * phase gates of the form Diag(1, Ï†) have no controls; and
--
-- * all other gates have at most one control.
